    <div class="testimonials">
        <p>“I highly recommend it for developers and product builders...I created a good enough design myself, without much time or money, and was able to launch my product. —Eric Davis, @edavis10</p>

        <p>“Design is often described as something mysterious, that can only be accomplished by the talented few. That's bullshit. Design is a skill that can be learned. It's also a process that can be reverse-engineered, to a degree. Jarrod's book will give you a huge head-start in both. —Jarkko Laine, @jarkko</p>
